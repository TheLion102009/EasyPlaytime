## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup (Optional)

For cross-server playtime synchronization, you can enable database support:

### Prerequisites
- MariaDB or MySQL server installed and running
- Database user with appropriate permissions

### Configuration
1. Open `plugins/EasyPlaytime/config.yml`
2. Set `database.enabled` to `true`
3. Configure your database connection:

```yaml
database:
  enabled: true
  host: "localhost"
  port: 3306
  database: "easyplaytime"
  username: "minecraft"
  password: "your_secure_password"
  table: "player_playtime"
```

### Migration
When you enable the database for the first time:
1. Update your configuration
2. Use `/eplaytime reload` 
3. The plugin will automatically migrate existing YAML data to the database

**Note:** The database user only needs `SELECT`, `INSERT`, and `UPDATE` permissions on the playtime table.
